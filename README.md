# HPE ProLiant ML110 Gen9 BIOS ROM 3.40_08_29_2 + iLO4

This repository provides access to the BIOS ROM 3.40_08_29_2 and iLO4 for the HPE ProLiant ML110 Gen9. It's unfortunate that users are often required to pay for these updates through official channels or resort to purchasing them on platforms like eBay.
HPE's decision not to provide BIOS updates for servers no longer under warranty is quite shameless, especially considering the ProLiant ML110 Gen9 is now a deprecated server. This repository aims to make these updates freely available to those who need them, without the unnecessary financial burden. It's a shame that such essential updates aren't more accessible to all users.
